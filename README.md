# Project README

This anonymous project is solely intended for academic purposes, specifically to supplement the methodology and experimental results presented in our upcoming research paper. The purpose of this repository is to provide a detailed explanation of the methodological framework and its operational principles, ensuring transparency and reproducibility of our work.

The majority of experiments in this project are based on modifications to the original MAS (Multi-Agent System) framework. Currently, the implementation is under development, and we are working to finalize a fully functional codebase that will be made available on GitHub as soon as possible.

Please note that this repository is not an official release but rather a temporary placeholder to support our research dissemination efforts. We appreciate your understanding as we work towards completing the project and making it publicly accessible in its entirety.

Thank you for your interest in our work.
